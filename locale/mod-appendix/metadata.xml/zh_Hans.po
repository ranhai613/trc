"PATCH AFTER MULTIVERSE\n"
"\n"
"An equipment expansion pack meant to be used alongside Multiverse. Includes many various weapon and drone concepts considered, for one reason or another, unfitting for the base mod.\n"
"While attempting to be balanced, due to the nature of the equipment in this pack as well as the fact it is not part of base Multiverse means there may be a higher variation of balance than usual. The new weapons include those that are niche, too conceptually similar to existing weapons, involve \"hard-to-balance\" gimmicks, or are just conceptually bizare.\n"
"Enemies can also spawn with some of these weapons, blue options are updated to include relevant equipment, and stores + Sylvan will sometimes sell them. Some items also have differing rarities in specific sectors.\n"
